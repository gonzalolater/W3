# ZKLOGIN

zkLogin is a feature in the Sui Network that provides native support for the OpenID Connect standard, allowing users to create on-chain accounts using their existing web2 services that support OpenID Connect, such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and many others [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui). This means that users can access the Sui Network without the need for private keys or mnemonics, streamlining user onboarding at scale.

The technical principles of zkLogin in the Sui Network involve the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to protect user privacy. ZKPs allow one party in a two-party transaction to accept a statement from the other party as true without needing additional information about the other party's veracity [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui). By leveraging ZKPs over OpenID payloads, zkLogin ensures that user privacy is maintained while still providing a secure and seamless onboarding experience.

Here are some key technical principles of zkLogin in the Sui Network:

1. OpenID Connect Integration: zkLogin integrates with existing web2 services that support OpenID Connect, allowing users to create on-chain accounts using their existing credentials [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui).

2. Zero-Knowledge Proofs: zkLogin utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to protect user privacy. This ensures that sensitive user information is not exposed during the authentication process [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui).

3. Seamless User Onboarding: With zkLogin, users can access the Sui Network without the need for private keys or mnemonics. This simplifies the user onboarding process and makes it more accessible to a wider audience [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui).

4. Privacy-Preserving Authentication: zkLogin ensures that user authentication is privacy-preserving by using zero-knowledge proofs. This means that the Sui Network does not need to know the user's actual identity or credentials, only that the authentication is valid [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui).

5. Enhanced Security: By leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, zkLogin enhances the security of user authentication in the Sui Network. It provides a secure and reliable way for users to access their on-chain accounts [[2]](https://sui.io/intro-to-sui).
