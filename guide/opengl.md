# OpenGL

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a powerful cross-platform graphics API (Application Programming Interface) used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics on various platforms, including desktop computers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It provides a set of functions and commands that allow developers to interact with the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and create visually appealing and interactive graphics applications.
