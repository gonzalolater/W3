Rust is programming language. It has its own language constructs, memory model, concurrent model, runtime service and linkage model. 

Tokens are the primitive productions in the language. The tokens have its categories such as keyword, identifier, literals, lifetime, punctuation and delimiter. These tokens are concatenated into language statements. The language clauses are broken down into different segments according to their kinds.

The macro invocation is processed at the compile time. The effect of macro invocation is to replace the invocation with the result of macro function.

The macro function should recognize the input parameters. The metavariables are used to denote different kinds of code fragments. When the input elements are matched with right metavariable, how many times of repeating the same operation are the next important aspect in the macro invocation.
