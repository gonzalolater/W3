Ethereum
1. blockchain technology beyond currency
2. opcodes instructions
3. account address controlled by private key
4. contract address controlled by contract code
5.  code execution

zysync
1. use zksnark to scale up. transaction
2. switch from privacy to scale up
3. knowledge proof: snark and stark
4. main chain as witness of state and side chain for transaction process
5. off chain computation
6. execute state transition functions correctly
7. data availability
8. transaction executed by evm
9. reconstruct the state
10. history and state

---
zksync
1. float history
2. many nodes in the merkle tree
3. transaction: generic transaction, balance transfer, program
4. proof verification and data availability
5. different storage space between layer1 and layer2

Innovation
1. DePINs
2. scroll zkevm
3. native layer2 code
4. migrate from layer1 to layer2

Ethereum protocol
1. client
   1. go
   2. java
   3. C#
2. node
   1. full node
   2. light node
   3. archival node

Layer2 network
1. level up and collect coins
2. application specific blockchain
3. user experience gets better every 6-12 months, so it is better to have a long bear market
4. patience is virtue
5. Ethereum is unfriendly with ZK proof.

Good culture requires:
1. documentation: writing things down
2. clear communication
3. value accrual

lesson learned
1. more than one implementation for the open protocol and ensure security and flexibility.
2. mission push instead of people push

---
Cairo
1. intermediate representation: sierra
2. assembly language
   1. fit well with ZK proof
   2. prove purpose
3. cairo vm
   1. field element
   2. generic type
   3. linear type system
