# Smart Account Wallet

### Solidity Contract

The deployEntryPoint function deploys a contract called 'EntryPoint' using the Hardhat deployments plugin. It also deploys a Create2Factory contract using the Create2Factory class from '../src/Create2Factory'.

The function starts by getting the signer's address from the provider. It then deploys the Create2Factory contract by calling its deployFactory function.

Next, the EntryPoint contract is deployed using the hre.deployments.deploy function. The deployment arguments include the 'from' address, an empty argument array, a gas limit of 6 million, and deterministic deployment set to true.

Finally, the function logs the address of the deployed EntryPoint contract.

**Provider and Signer**

TypeScript code that includes various functions and classes related to sending user operations (UserOp) in Ethereum.

Here is a brief overview of the code:

- The code imports various libraries and dependencies related to Ethereum and smart contracts.
- It defines a type called `SendUserOp` which represents a function that sends a UserOp and returns a Promise of a TransactionResponse or undefined.
- The code includes a function called `rpcUserOpSender` which creates a function that sends a UserOp using a JSON-RPC provider.
- It also includes a function called `queueUserOpSender` which creates a function that queues UserOps and sends them in batches.
- The code defines a class called `AAProvider` which extends the BaseProvider class and represents a provider for account abstraction.
- It also defines a class called `AASigner` which extends the Signer class and represents a signer for account abstraction.
- The code includes a function called `localUserOpSender` which creates a function that sends a UserOp locally (for testing purposes).
- Finally, the code includes a function called `sendQueuedUserOps` which sends queued UserOps in batches to an entry point contract.

Please note that without additional context or specific requirements, it is difficult to provide a more detailed explanation or assistance.
