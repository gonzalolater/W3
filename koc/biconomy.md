# Smart Account 

The Biconomy Smart Accounts are signer agnostic, which allows you to use any authorization package of your choice as long as you can pass a signer to our SDK upon the creation of a Smart Account.

Biconomy offers a Paymaster service designed with one of the best developer experiences in mind. Simply use one URL and switch modes between our sponsorship paymaster and our Token Paymaster.

The Bundler is a service that tracks userOps that exist in an alternative mem pool and as the name suggests, bundles them together to send to an Entry Point Contract for eventual execution onchain.

Building and sending UserOperations is a key offering of any toolkit designed for ERC4337. The Biconomy account package stands as an exemplary toolkit in this regard. Meticulously crafted with developers' needs in mind, this package seamlessly integrates the essential features associated with ERC-4337. It simplifies the process of creating and sending UserOperations, thus optimizing the development and management of decentralized applications (dApps).

The Biconomy account package achieves this by providing a comprehensive set of methods that enable developers to effortlessly create UserOperations. Combined with the sophisticated backend infrastructure of the Biconomy platform, it ensures efficient and reliable transmission of these operations across EVM networks.
