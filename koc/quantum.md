Quantum computing has the potential to break many of the existing cryptographic algorithms that are commonly used today, particularly those based on the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which are the foundation of public key cryptography. To resist quantum computing attacks, researchers are actively developing and studying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms. PQC algorithms are designed to be resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers. 

Here are a few examples of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are currently being researched:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography**: Lattice-based cryptography relies on the hardness of certain mathematical problems related to lattices, such as the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem. Examples of lattice-based schemes include NTRUEncrypt, Kyber, and NewHope.

2. **Code-based cryptography**: Code-based cryptography is based on error-correcting codes. It utilizes the difficulty of decoding certain linear codes that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers. The McEliece cryptosystem is a well-known code-based encryption scheme.

3. **Multivariate cryptography**: Multivariate cryptography is based on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations. Examples of multivariate schemes include the Hidden Field Equations (HFE) and the Rainbow signature scheme.

4. **Hash-based cryptography**: Hash-based cryptography is based on one-way hash functions. These functions are used to generate digital signatures, which can provide authentication and integrity. The Merkle signature scheme and the Lamport signature scheme are examples of hash-based signature schemes.

5. **Isogeny-based cryptography**: Isogeny-based cryptography is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms in certain elliptic curve isogeny problems. The Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange and the SIKE encryption scheme are examples of isogeny-based algorithms.
