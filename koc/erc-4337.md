# ERC-4337

Components:
- User Operation
- Bundlers
- Entry Point
- Contract Account
- Pay Masters
- Aggregaters

Two phrases: verification and execution

The bundler listens to UserOperations mempool, bundles an array of UserOperations, relays the bundles to the Entry Point.

The EntryPoint is a singleton contract that acts as a central entity for all ERC-4337 Smart Accounts and Paymasters. It coordinates the verification and execution of a User Operation.

Essentially there are two phases:

1. Verification loop: Verifies that each UserOperation is valid by checking it with both the Smart Account and the Paymaster contract.
2. Execution loop: Sends the callData in each UserOperation to the Smart Account.
