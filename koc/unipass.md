### Unipass Wallet

UniPass is a decentralized identity management system that uses blockchain technology to securely store and manage personal information. When a user creates an account on UniPass, the platform generates a unique private key for them. This private key is used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data stored in the user's account wallet.

Here's how UniPass generates the private key and account wallet:

1. The user creates an account on UniPass by providing their email address and password.
2. Once the account is created, UniPass generates a cryptographically secure random number, known as a nonce, which is used to create the private key.
3. The nonce is combined with the user's email address and password using a one-way hashing function, such as SHA-256 or Keccak-256. This creates a unique digital signature that is used to generate the private key.
4. The private key is then generated using a combination of the nonce, the user's email address, and the hashed password. This ensures that the private key is unique to each user and cannot be easily guessed or reverse-engineered.
5. Once the private key is generated, it is used to create an account wallet. The account wallet is a virtual container that stores all of the user's personal information, such as their name, address, phone number, and other identifying details.
6. The account wallet is encrypted using the private key, which ensures that only the user can access their personal information.
7. The encrypted account wallet is then stored on the UniPass blockchain, which is a decentralized network of computers that record transactions and data in a secure and transparent manner.
8. When the user logs into their UniPass account, they provide their email address and password, which are used to regenerate the private key. This allows them to access their account wallet and view their personal information.

Overall, UniPass's approach to generating private keys and account wallets is designed to ensure the security and privacy of users' personal information. By using a combination of cryptographic techniques and decentralized blockchain technology, UniPass provides a secure and trustworthy platform for managing personal information.

### Meta Transactions

Meta-transactions are a feature in the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to perform actions on behalf of another user without needing to hold the private key of that user's Ethereum address. This can be useful in a variety of scenarios, such as when a user wants to authorize another user to perform a specific action on their behalf, or when a user wants to delegate the execution of a smart contract to another user.

Meta-transactions work by creating a new type of transaction called a "meta-transaction". This transaction contains a payload that specifies the action to be performed, as well as the address of the user who will be performing the action. The meta-transaction is then signed by the user who is authorizing the action, and broadcast to the Ethereum network.

Once the meta-transaction is included in a block, the Ethereum network will execute the action specified in the payload, using the address of the user who signed the transaction as the sender. This allows the user who signed the transaction to act as a proxy for the user whose address was specified in the payload, effectively allowing them to perform actions on behalf of that user.

One of the main benefits of meta-transactions is that they allow for greater flexibility and convenience in the way that users interact with smart contracts. For example, a user may want to authorize another user to perform a specific action on their behalf, but they may not want to give that user direct access to their private key. By using a meta-transaction, the user can grant permission for the action to be performed without having to share their private key.

Another benefit of meta-transactions is that they can help to reduce the computational overhead associated with processing transactions on the Ethereum network. Because meta-transactions are essentially just a wrapper around a regular transaction, they can be processed more quickly and efficiently than regular transactions. This can help to improve the overall performance of the Ethereum network, and make it easier for users to interact with smart contracts.

However, it's worth noting that meta-transactions also introduce some additional complexity and security risks. For example, because meta-transactions allow users to perform actions on behalf of another user, there is a risk that a malicious user could use a meta-transaction to impersonate another user and perform unauthorized actions. To mitigate this risk, it's important to carefully consider the security implications of using meta-transactions, and to implement appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Code Navigation

The unipass wallet SDK package is consisted of provider, transaction builder, wallet, session key, keys and network. The provider instance should be created at the fist step. The wallet can be got from the provider instance. The session key is constructed to build the transaction. The actual wallet is made by filling in the keys, RPC url, relayer. The transaction will be sent by the wallet.

The "Wallet" class extends the "Signer" class from the ethers library, which allows it to sign Ethereum transactions. It has various methods for interacting with the Unipass Wallet, such as getting the wallet address, signing messages, estimating gas costs, sending transactions, and more.

The class takes in a set of options when instantiated, including the wallet address, keyset (a set of keys associated with the wallet), context (the Unipass Wallet context), provider (Ethereum provider), and relayer (a relayer service for submitting transactions).

The code also includes other supporting classes and interfaces used by the "Wallet" class, such as "Keyset" (representing a set of keys), "Relayer" (for relaying transactions), "Transaction" (representing an Ethereum transaction), and others.
