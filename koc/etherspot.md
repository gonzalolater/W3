# EtherSpot Smart Account

With Web3Auth, users handle keys similar to a multi-factor account, where they use their OAuth login, devices and other factors to manage their key pairs. Using Web3Auth, the user is always in control of ownership and access to their cryptographic key pair. Login services only ever have access to one share, and thus it's not possible for the provider to retrieve the user's private key on their own.

Bundlers are the backbone of 4337, their purpose is to read from a mempool of userOperations and bundle these together, to ensure multiple transactions are included on chain at a lower cost.

With account abstraction, the boundary between EOAs and contract accounts becomes blurred. It enables the creation of new types of accounts called “contract-type accounts” or simply “accounts.” These accounts can hold both code and ether, and they can execute transactions and smart contract functions. This means that contracts can directly control and manipulate funds, eliminating the need for a separate EOA to initiate transactions.

ERC-4337 consists of four main components: UserOperations, Bundlers, EntryPoint, and Contract Accounts. Paymasters and Aggregators can also complement these components.

UserOperations: These are pseudo-transaction objects generated by your application, facilitating the execution of transactions with contract accounts.

Bundlers: These are actors responsible for gathering UserOperations from a mempool and transmitting them to the EntryPoint contract on the blockchain.

EntryPoint: This is a singleton smart contract that handles the verification and execution logic for transactions.

Contract Accounts: These are smart contract accounts owned by users.

Paymasters: These optional smart contract accounts can sponsor transactions for Contract Accounts.

Aggregators: These optional smart contracts can validate signatures for multiple Contract Accounts.

EtherspotWallet is a EIP4337 compliant smart contract that acts as a multi-ownership wallet. It allows multiple owners to control a single account and execute transactions via an entry point contract. It also allows for guardian account recovery.
