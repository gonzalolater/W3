# EIP-155

EIP-155 refers to Ethereum Improvement Proposal 155. It is a proposal that introduces a chain ID to the Ethereum network to prevent replay attacks and provide better security when interacting with different Ethereum-based networks.

Before the introduction of EIP-155, transactions sent to different Ethereum networks (mainnet, testnets, private networks) had the same structure and were susceptible to replay attacks. A replay attack occurs when a transaction intended for one network is maliciously or unintentionally replayed on another network, leading to unintended consequences or loss of funds.

EIP-155 introduces a new parameter called the chain ID, which is included in the transaction data. The chain ID uniquely identifies the network or blockchain instance to which the transaction is intended. By including the chain ID in the transaction, it becomes invalid if it is replayed on a different network with a different chain ID.

The introduction of EIP-155 and the use of chain IDs significantly improve the security and reliability of transactions by protecting them from unintended replays on different Ethereum networks. It allows users to have confidence that their transactions are executed on the correct network and helps prevent potential loss or unintended actions.

It's worth noting that EIP-155 was implemented in October 2016 as part of the Byzantium hard fork on the Ethereum mainnet. Since then, it has become a standard practice for Ethereum-based networks to include chain IDs in their transactions to ensure compatibility and security.
