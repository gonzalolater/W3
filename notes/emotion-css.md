# Emotion CSS

Emotion CSS is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to write styles in JavaScript or TypeScript and generate dynamic CSS stylesheets at runtime. It provides a way to encapsulate styles within components, enabling the creation of self-contained and reusable styling logic.

Emotion CSS offers several key features:

1. **Interpolation**: Emotion CSS allows you to interpolate JavaScript values within your styles. This means you can use variables, functions, and expressions to dynamically generate styles based on the component's props or other dynamic data.

2. **CSS Prop**: Emotion CSS introduces a `css` prop that you can use directly within your JSX components. This prop accepts a style object or a template literal string containing CSS rules. It automatically generates and injects CSS styles into the document, ensuring the styles are applied to the corresponding component.

3. **Styled Components**: Emotion CSS provides a `styled` API that allows you to create styled components. This API lets you define reusable styled components with specific styles and props. It leverages the power of template literals to create dynamic styles based on props or other data.

4. **Performance optimizations**: Emotion CSS employs various performance optimizations, such as automatic critical CSS extraction, style caching, and efficient style injection. These optimizations help reduce the overhead and improve the runtime performance of your styled components.

In Emotion CSS, template literals are used to define styles within the className prop of JSX components. The template literal is passed to the css function provided by Emotion CSS, which converts the styles into CSS and injects them into the document. The css function evaluates the template literal and converts it into a CSS string. It also generates a unique class name for the styles.

The return type of the css function in Emotion CSS is a unique class name or a combination of class names. The css function generates a unique identifier for the defined styles and returns it as a string.

The Emotion CSS function, css, does not require parentheses around the template literal because it is a tagged template literal function. Tagged template literals in JavaScript are a feature that allows you to customize the behavior of template literals by prefixing them with a function name.

When you use the css function from Emotion CSS, it acts as a tag for the template literal. The template literal is passed as an argument to the css function without the need for explicit parentheses.

A tagged template literal function is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to customize the behavior of template literals by prefixing them with a function name. It provides a way to process template literals in a specialized manner, enabling you to perform custom logic or transformations on the template literal's contents.
