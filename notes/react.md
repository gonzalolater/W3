# ReactJS

### Common Modules

The `classnames` module is a popular utility library for conditionally joining class names together in React. The "cross-env" node module is a command-line utility that allows you to set environment variables in a cross-platform manner. It is commonly used in npm scripts to ensure consistent behavior across different operating systems.

In Umi.js, the `useModel` hook is used to access and manage the state and actions defined in a model. It allows you to interact with the model's state and trigger actions from within a functional component.
