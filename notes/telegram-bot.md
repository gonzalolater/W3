### Bot

Bots are small applications that run entirely within the Telegram app. Users interact with bots through flexible interfaces that can support any kind of task or service. Telegram bots can host Mini Apps built with JavaScript. This allows for infinitely flexible interfaces that can power everything from online stores to arcade games. Unlike websites, bots support seamless authorization and notifications through Telegram out of the box.

Using HTML5, developers can create immersive single or multi-player games that allow users to team up or compete for the highest score.

Telegram bots are special accounts that do not need a phone number to set up. Bots are connected to their owner’s server, which processes inputs and requests from users.

Telegram’s intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API. Developers communicate with this server via an easy HTTPS-interface with a simplified version of the Telegram API – known as the Bot API.

At its core, you can think of the Telegram Bot API as software that provides JSON-encoded responses to your queries.

A bot, on the other hand, is essentially a routine, software or script that queries the API by means of an HTTPS request and waits for a response. There are several types of requests you can make, as well as many different objects that you can use and receive as responses.

With Mini Apps developers can use JavaScript to create infinitely flexible interfaces that can be launched right inside Telegram — and can completely replace any website.

Telegram currently supports six different ways of launching Mini Apps: from a keyboard button, from an inline button, from the bot menu button, via inline mode, from a direct link – and even from the attachment menu.
