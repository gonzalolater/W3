### Bot

Bots are small applications that run entirely within the Telegram app. Users interact with bots through flexible interfaces that can support any kind of task or service. Telegram bots can host Mini Apps built with JavaScript. This allows for infinitely flexible interfaces that can power everything from online stores to arcade games. Unlike websites, bots support seamless authorization and notifications through Telegram out of the box.

Using HTML5, developers can create immersive single or multi-player games that allow users to team up or compete for the highest score.
