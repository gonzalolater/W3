# ZKVM

The library file is the root module and part of the crate library. The data structure, function, reference and module can be defined in the root module. Other crate can reference public source code items in the root module. What features the zkem must have are program encode and decode, program execution, program trace. The aspects of trace includes the state, instruction, memory hints and immutable data. 

All of the mathematic problem can be solved in the function. The cubic operation is one kind of arithmetic operations. Rank one constraint system is one kind of proof system. 

The commands are offered through the main entry function. The instruction set is appended with cryptographic instructions. The cryptographic instructions are also operation codes of mathematic algorithms on the finite field.

The field structure is particular data structure created by the Jolt team. The commitment scheme is also a special data structure. The byte code, instruction, memory, rank one constraint system are verified by the virtual machine. The memory can be read and written by the program.
