# RISC ZERO

The cryptographic functions are implemented by the circuits. The program is executed against the cryptographic  functions and the receipts are collected for proofing. The merkle root is one kind of proof. The Groth16 prover and verifier are implemented by rust language and used in this project.

The modules are defined in the library source file. The module name appears in the current scope. The functions are defined in this module. When this module is loaded and resolved, the items can be used directly. Various functions are created to handle different data types and do the mathematic computation. 

The seal object is structure type and holds three fields that represent the composition of a seal. The seal should know the element size and group size. The values and curve are expressed in the format of json. The vector data type is frequently used to stand for the data. The structure and vector data instance are the valid data input of enumeration types.

The docker container technology is leveraged to do the calculation task. The independent calculation is wrappedin the docker image. The docker image is invoked as language shell command to do this computation work. The seal is a special and complex data structure. It is particular for field elements. The verify key, proof and prepared inputs are three fragments of the verifier. The verifier does this verification work of checking the mathematic relationship between its three ingredients.

The source code items are included in the file and they are scoped according to the language rules. The foreignfunction interface is utilized to glue the c mathematics library with current rust codes. The events are tracked for instruction, register and memory operations. The segement includes all the information about the pre state, post state, system calls, input digest and output digest. 

Heterogeneous architecture layer is supported and central process unit, univeral device architecture are adopted as well as the metal machine. These are related to hardware side and its implementations. The emunator is written in the software to simulate the hardware interfaces.
