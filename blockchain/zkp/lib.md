The polynomial is the term in the algebra. The field element is defined as concrete type. The coefficients are described by the vector data type. The field operations can be performed on single field element or process the field elements in the batch mode. The field elements are evaluated according the mathematical rules. 

Cario is a programming language that can be used to write any kinds of software programs. The virtual machine is one kind of this program. Since this language supports the circuit implementations, the power is bounded with the virtual machine. The virtual machine implemented by Cario language is enlarged by the language itself. 

The module is placed or nested in the one crate. The crate keyword can stand for the current crate where it is located. The crate can be used as module path to reference other modules. The mod keyword is just to declare the module. The module reference is done by the use keyword. 

There are two types of macros in the Rust language. They are declarative macro and procedural macro. The declarative macro is defined by the `macro_rules` macro. There are basic and meta macros in the language, therefore custom macros can be created by these native macros in the language. 

The procedural macro is alike a function in the Rust language. The input parameter for this function is special and particular. The declarative macro is used by direct invocation prefixed with the exclamation symbol. The procedural macro is decorated as the attributes and added into the decorating functions. 

The function procedural macro has the same effect as the function created by the macro rules. The attribute procedural macro is common type. The derive macro is a special type of attribute procedural macro. The derive macro has the attribute name as derive. The attribute procedural macro has its custom name.
