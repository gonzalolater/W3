# Substrate Framework

There are three parts: client, pallet and runtime. The runtime interface provides type, traits and macro primitives. One crate is represented by the cargo toml file. The token stream type is the stream of tokens. Two of macro functions are executed in the body of keyword module. 

The macro function is the meta-programming style. The input parameter are the source items provided by the developers. The output will be the generated new codes. The codes can be generated dynamically and implanted into the placeholder during the compile time.

The input parameter of the macro attribution function is the token stream. The token stream type can be coerced into the concrete types. The information of this concise type can be parsed. The current module can use other module's code items. The single quote is used to stand for the lifetime constraint for the reference. The root module organizes the modules and exposes the public items. 

The input parameters can be analyzed and constructed the new variables. The variables can act as the values for the placeholders in the string template. The curly brace can be the set operator in the use clause. The client is responsible for the basic and core features. The runtime is responsible for the transactions and block execution. The runtime is composed of various pallets.
