# Substrate Framework

There are three parts: client, pallet and runtime. The runtime interface provides type, traits and macro primitives. One crate is represented by the cargo toml file. The token stream type is the stream of tokens. Two of macro functions are executed in the body of keyword module. 

The macro function is the meta-programming style. The input parameter are the source items provided by the developers. The output will be the generated new codes. The codes can be generated dynamically and implanted into the placeholder during the compile time.
