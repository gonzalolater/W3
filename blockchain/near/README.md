# Near Network

The access key can combine the account id and public key together. It also has the nonce value for transaction replay and permission property for access control and authorization. The account without access key can have code and invoked by other account or contract. However, it can not trigger the actions directly. The full access permission can deploy the contract, transfer the token, call functions, stake the token and delete the account.

The near network has the domain name system so that the account id can be a valid domain name. The account id can also be the implicit account id represented by the public key and generated by the key pair cryptography algorithm. The account is identified by the account id. The account has the attributes of balance, locked balance,code of contract, key-value storage for contract state, access key and other stuffs.
