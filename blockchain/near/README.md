# Near Network

The access key can combine the account id and public key together. It also has the nonce value for transaction replay and permission property for access control and authorization. The account without access key can have code and invoked by other account or contract. However, it can not trigger the actions directly. The full access permission can deploy the contract, transfer the token, call functions, stake the token and delete the account.  
The near network has the domain name system so that the account id can be a valid domain name. The account id can also be the implicit account id represented by the public key and generated by the key pair cryptography algorithm. The account is identified by the account id. The account has the attributes of balance, locked balance,code of contract, key-value storage for contract state, access key and other stuffs. 

The merkle root can verify the merkle proof. The users send the transactions to the blockchain network through the API interface. The blockchain layer is responsible for the transaction validity and ordering which is ensured by the consensus mechanism. The runtime layer takes charge of the transaction execution and state updates. All blocks are split into epochs. When the epoch changes, the new validator set is selected. The validator rotation is finished in the epoch cycle. The transaction receipt is also provided by the runtime layer. The transaction fee is the sum of generating transaction receipt and performing the transaction actions.

## TypeScript Tool

Types in the typescript language can be defined using type alias, interface, class, enumeration and imported types from other modules. Values are created through variable declaration, module declaration, enumeration declaration, class declaration, imported values from other modules. 

The primitive types are not objects and have no methods. The primitive types include number,string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint. The object types are collection of key value pairs. The object types contain object, array, function, date, regular expression. Some special types are introduced as the additional types which can be used in some specific environments. The special types have buffer, stream, promise. The buffer type is the binary data of primitive types. The stream type is used in the input and output of file operations.

Typed array are array-like objects that provide a mechanism for reading and writing the raw binary data in the memory buffer. The typed array specifies the element type in the array. The byte type of array elements can be 8-bits integer, unsigned 8-bits integer, and 32 bits float number. The set and map are collections that allow for storing the unique item or key-value pairs. The weak map and set are similar to the map and set, but allow for garbage collection of keys or values that are no longer referenced.

The promise represents a future value in the asynchronous operations. A proxy object enables defining custom behaviors for fundamental operations. The reflect object provides methods for interceptable javascript operations.It can be used for metaprogramming. The function type can be categorized as common function, arrow function, anonymous function, higher-order function and closure function. The double question mark operator can tell us whether the value is undefined/null or not. The question mark plus the dot character can handle the target object's emptiness when accessing its property. 

The optional chaining operator can ensure that expressions are chained and continuous execution. The template literal allows for multiple-lines strings and string interpolation. The generator function can be paused and resumed, returning an iterator. The error types are important for error handling. There are built-in types of error, type error, reference error and syntax error. The class type provides a way to create objects with the shared properties and methods. The class definition can include constructor and methods. The constructor method is called when an instance of the class is created. It initializes the object's properties. Classes can inherit from other classes by using the extend keyword. The access modifiers are provided to control the visibility of the class members. The static members belong to the class instead of the instance of the class. The interface can be used to define the structure of a class. 

A compiler is a computer program that translates code written in a high-level programming language into a low-level language. The main purpose of a compiler is to automate the translation process, ensure the correctness of the output, and report any errors in the source code.

A typical compiler can be divided into the following main phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, code generation and symbol table management. Compilers can be designed using various techniques, including parsing techniques, code generation strategies, optimization techniques, memory management, error handling.

A lexicon is a dictionary or vocabulary of a language. It refers to the complete set of words and their meanings that make up a language. It is a fundamental component of a language, distinct from its grammar and syntax. Lexicon focuses on the field of lexicography, which involves the compilation and study of dictionaries and vocabularies. The syntax are the rules that govern how words are combined to form grammatical sentences, including word order and sentence structure. Semantics is the study of the meaning and contents of words and language. 

An abstract syntax tree is a tree-like data structure that represents the syntactic structure of a programming language. It is an abstract representation of the code, capturing the essential elements and their relationship, while omitting unnecessary details. The sequence of tokens is parsed into a tree-like structure, where each node represents a syntactic construct in the programming language. The abstract syntax tree is a tree-like data structure, where each node represents a construct in the programming language, such as a variable declaration, a function call, or an arithmetic expression. The relationship between these constructs are represented by the tree data structure, with parent-child relationship indicating the hierarchical nature of the code.

Each node in the abstract syntax tree represents a specific construct in the programming language. The specific structure of abstract syntax tree may vary, depending on the programming language. The node types in the abstract syntax tree are literal node, variable node, operator node, function node, control flow node, assignment node, class node, method node, import node, include node and comment node. 

A formal language is a set of strings of symbols that are governed by specific grammatical rules. These symbols include letters, numbers and other characters. Every expression has a clear and unambiguous meaning. Formal languages have defined syntax and semantics. Words and sentences in the natural language can have multiple meanings based on the context. Natural languages can express a wide range of ideas and emotions. 

Formal language theory is essential for the development of compilers and interpreters, which translate high-level programming language into machine readable code. Parser and lexical analyzers, which are the core component of compilers, rely on formal language concepts to recognize and process the structure of programs. Formal languages can be used to specify the behavior of software systems and hardware design in a precise, mathematical way. This allows for formal verification techniques, such as model checking and theorem proving, to be applied to ensure the correctness and reliability of these systems.

Formal languages, such as regular expressions and context free grammars, can be used to describe and analyze the computation process underlying various algorithms and data structures. Formal languages provide the mathematical framework for studying the properties and limitations of different classes of languages and their associated computational models.  A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, operating, storing data. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem or performing a task.
