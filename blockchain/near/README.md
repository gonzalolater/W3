# Near Network

The access key can combine the account id and public key together. It also has the nonce value for transaction replay and permission property for access control and authorization. The account without access key can have code and invoked by other account or contract. However, it can not trigger the actions directly. The full access permission can deploy the contract, transfer the token, call functions, stake the token and delete the account.  
The near network has the domain name system so that the account id can be a valid domain name. The account id can also be the implicit account id represented by the public key and generated by the key pair cryptography algorithm. The account is identified by the account id. The account has the attributes of balance, locked balance,code of contract, key-value storage for contract state, access key and other stuffs. 

The merkle root can verify the merkle proof. The users send the transactions to the blockchain network through the API interface. The blockchain layer is responsible for the transaction validity and ordering which is ensured by the consensus mechanism. The runtime layer takes charge of the transaction execution and state updates. All blocks are split into epochs. When the epoch changes, the new validator set is selected. The validator rotation is finished in the epoch cycle. The transaction receipt is also provided by the runtime layer. The transaction fee is the sum of generating transaction receipt and performing the transaction actions.

## TypeScript Tool

Types in the typescript language can be defined using type alias, interface, class, enumeration and imported types from other modules. Values are created through variable declaration, module declaration, enumeration declaration, class declaration, imported values from other modules. 

The primitive types are not objects and have no methods. The primitive types include number,string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint. The object types are collection of key value pairs. The object types contain object, array, function, date, regular expression. Some special types are introduced as the additional types which can be used in some specific environments. The special types have buffer, stream, promise. The buffer type is the binary data of primitive types. The stream type is used in the input and output of file operations.
