# Standard Library

The existing object or vector in the memory can be referenced. The structure type is created to depict this reference. The template class is used and the generic class is the type in the vector. The fields appear in the private section. The types and methods are listed in the public area.

The algorithms are implemented on the directed graph. The relationship and attribute of graph vertex can be figured out from the providing algorithms. The node and vertex can be searched by the given condition. The color cocde has its predefined constant value. In essence, the assertion is conditional expression. It is equal to ternary operator.

The using keyword is capable of giving new name to the customized type. It can also import other code items into the current scope. The common data type and algorithm is the fundamental fragment in the whole project. The hash is the container of bytes. The number of bytes is fixed. It can be created from various formats.
