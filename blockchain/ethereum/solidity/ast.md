# Abstract Syntax Tree

The assignment is converted into binary operation. The single and plural forms are two basic forms for the object in the language. The item and list data structure can be used to support them. Bitwise operations are the fundamental operations performed on the individual bits of binary number. 

The bit and operation is useful for masking specific bits. It is easy to know that the single bit of binary number is zero or one value in its position. The parts of the binary number can be cleaned to be zero or one. The or bit operation is used to set specific bits in the binary number. 

The byte stream is the original source stream. The character stream is an abstraction over the byte stream. It is text based input and output. High level operations can be performed on the character stream. The line and column are the number and method of telling us the location of source tokens. The class has constructor function,associated methods and destructor function. The line and column can be transformed into the position data. The number can be in the form of decimal or hex format.
