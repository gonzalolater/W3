# Abstract Syntax Tree

The assignment is converted into binary operation. The single and plural forms are two basic forms for the object in the language. The item and list data structure can be used to support them. Bitwise operations are the fundamental operations performed on the individual bits of binary number. 

The bit and operation is useful for masking specific bits. It is easy to know that the single bit of binary number is zero or one value in its position. The parts of the binary number can be cleaned to be zero or one. The or bit operation is used to set specific bits in the binary number. 

The byte stream is the original source stream. The character stream is an abstraction over the byte stream. It is text based input and output. High level operations can be performed on the character stream. The line and column are the number and method of telling us the location of source tokens. The class has constructor function,associated methods and destructor function. The line and column can be transformed into the position data. The number can be in the form of decimal or hex format. 

The three fields of native location, source location and tree id produce one instance of debug data. The debug data gives the information of the location and values. The fork name is the version of ethereum virtual machine. The different upgrade name stands for the different version. The version is portrayed as the enumeration type. The concrete exception and error are illustrated. The enumeration type is depicted as the different categories of exception and error.

The scanner is acted as the token lookup. The token is scanned and recorded. The source location is consisted of start index, end index and source file name. It is the token's position in the source code file. The line and column is the coordinate point which can refer to the location of the source item.

The token has name, string value and precedence. The token may be keyword type token or normal type token. All of them are sketched as enumeration type. The token is divided into different sections. Each token has a integer value. The range of tokens can be found by comparing their number value. 

The symbol is loaded by the name with the help of loader. The various algorithms are adopted to perform the rules and relationship checks on the variables and statements.
