The proof is the merkle tree and its root hash. The block, state and transaction list have their proof. They should be verified to ensure its correctness. The blocks are processed in the batch mode. The batch size controls how many blocks are processed in one time. The block data are migrated from current hot storage into the cold storage. The blob sidecars are also migrated at the same time. 

The byte vector type is a generic type. Different length bytes can be generated by passing the length parameter. The complex type is composed of primitive types. The computer name can alias as the human readable name. The new type is created by using the equal operator in the typescript language. Each encoding world has its complete set of data types. When the data is encoded, the corresponding type is transformed. 

The block producer may be either builder or the engine. The fork name is the key and the type is the value. The fork name is computed by the bracket operator. The main fields of the data types are important items for the consensus layer. The later the upgrade is, the more fields are added.
