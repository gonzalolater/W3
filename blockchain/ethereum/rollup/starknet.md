# Starknet

The starknet is a coordinate system, with each component---sequencer, prover, and nodes --- playing a specific yet interconnected roles. The memory pool gateway will receive transactions from the users. The sequencer then incorporates the transaction and marks its state. The prover executes the block, calculates the proofs and submits it into layer one network for verification.
