1. generate the internal address
- return type: slice

The namespace serves the purpose of separating the code items. The symbol value has the type and id. The symbol could be parameters, variables, functions, type names, global variables and constant variables. The symbol table is able to add and lookup the keywords. The source code can be represented by the file description. The file description holds the file name and its text content.
