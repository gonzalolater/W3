# The Open Network

It is a huge distributed supercomputer. It is a collection of blockchain. They are unique master blockchain and working blockchains. The working blockchain can divide into the shard chains. The block hash on the master chain act as the global state. Everything is a bag of cell. The virtual machine is a stack machine. Both of bit strings and byte strings are supported. Messages are sent from one account to another account.

The contract language is function c style. It is compiled into assembly codes. The assembly codes are converted into binary codes by the fift assembler. The operation codes can be used directly the func language. The functions can also be implemented by the assembly codes.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is made of codes and data. The data is the state and the code is logic. The language has strict types. The error during the compilation time can detect the problem ahead of runtime. Here is a [tutorial](http://tonhelloworld.com/02-contract/) for reference.
